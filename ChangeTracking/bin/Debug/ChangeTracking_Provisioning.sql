    IMPORTANT! "SQLCMD Mode" must be activated prior to execution (under the Query menu in SSMS).

    BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCRIPT, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU TAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATABASE.

    This SQLCMD script is designed to be executed through MSBuild (via the .sqlproj Deploy target) however
    it can also be run manually using SQL Management Studio.

    It was generated by the SQL Change Automation build task and contains logic to deploy the database, ensuring that
    each of the incremental migrations is executed a single time only in alphabetical (filename)
    order. If any errors occur within those scripts, the deployment will be aborted and the transaction
    rolled-back.

    NOTE: Automatic transaction management is provided for incremental migrations, so you don't need to
          add any special BEGIN TRAN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK logic in those script files.
          However if you require transaction handling in your Pre/Post-Deployment scripts, you will
          need to add this logic to the source .sql files yourself.
